# Xgist
Xgist is a Xcode extension to send code to GitHub's Gist.
The extension will send your selection or entire file to Gist and automatically copy the Gist URL into your Clipboard. 
Be aware that it will replace your current clipboard with the Gist URL!
If you prefer, the binary (unsigned) is [here](https://github.com/Bunn/Xgist/releases/latest)
